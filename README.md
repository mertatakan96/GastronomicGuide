# Gastronomic Guide

The Gastronomic Guide is a web-based application developed with the objective of offering an accessible, user-friendly platform for users to explore restaurants across various cities, view detailed information about each restaurant, and see the location of selected restaurants on a map. Additionally, a unique feature of the application allows users to create a route on the map by clicking on the marker and pressing the 'Go' button. For a more immersive experience, the application also provides a street view feature that allows users to virtually navigate the vicinity of the restaurant. Each restaurant is rated by the renowned food critic Vedat Mil√∂r, ensuring users have a trusted guide for their culinary journeys.
